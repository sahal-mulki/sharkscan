# SharkScan

### About

SharkScan, An opensource network scanner. 

SharkScan is a network Scanner which shows all the hosts on the network. 
It also has builtin MAC parsing which shows the brands of the devices on the network.

### How to use SharkScan?

There are two ways in which you can use SharkScan

 1. Run the python file(all requirements are pre-installed).
 2. Run the .exe file in the releases tab(https://github.com/sahal-mulki/sharkscan/releases). Windows SmartScan detects my compiled program as a virus even though it isn't. Also the .exe  file takes some time to run.
